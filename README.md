Simulating hospital supply and demand for COVID19 

This project consists of two R scripts: **(1) setup** and **(2) simulation**    
The libraries needed to run the simulation are housed in `setup.R` script.   
The `simulation.R` script, in turn, synthesizes a hypothetical supply and demand dataset based on time and region. It then makes predictions for supply and demand in time using ARIMA model.
